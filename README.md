# Momentum
A personal dashboard featuring a to-do list, weather, and quote.

## Introduction
Google Chrome has various dashboard extensions. The idea of this project starts with one of them, [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca). Momentum is an extension page that replaces the new tab with a personal dashboard. 

This momentum project does not exactly clone the momentum extension as it is, so the UI does not match perfectly. Because this project focus to show function more than Momentum. The project will provide a to-do list, a weather check of your current location, random photos, and random quotes.
